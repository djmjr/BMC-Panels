# BMC Panels
 Graphics for Barton Musical Circuits Eurorack module panels
 
 I assembled many BMC modules and purchased the aluminum panels with them. After spray painting the panels, I printed these templates out on waterslide decals after creating them in Inkscape, and then water-slid them onto the panels. Most of them came out pretty nicely. I thought I'd share, since it took me a bit of work to create them all.

The files are provided individually as well, but to save time and to give an idea of the aesthetic I used, here are the pages of templates I compiled to print on single sheets of waterslide decal paper. Use the border lines or register boxes in the corners (depending on the template) to cut out the decals.
