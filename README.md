# BMC Panels
 Graphics for Barton Musical Circuits Eurorack module panels
 
 I assembled many BMC modules and purchased the aluminum panels with them. After spray painting the panels, I printed these templates out on waterslide decals, and then water-slid them onto the panels. Most of them came out pretty nicely. I thought I'd share, since it took me a bit of work to create them all.
